Now that #2 is in the fermenter it's time to think about #3. I've got a 3 week holiday planned so there's going to be a pretty big gap between brews so this may change radically once I taste #1 & #2.

My plan so far is to pretty much do a copy of #2 with some minor changes:

1. Add flaked oats to see how that turns out
1. Adjust the hops based on how #2 tastes. Probably put the bittering hops in a little later
1. I'm also going to get some pH strips and potentially drop it down since I feel it might be too high currently
