An attempt to create a spiced ale rather than something with fruity hops. The beer both tasted bad and ended up as bottle bombs. I ended up using fractional concentration to create 3 bottles of ~10% beer.

Ingredients
---------

* Maris otter 1kg
* golden promise 200g
* Ginger
* Fruit tea
* Cinnamon
* T-58 yeast

Ended up just plain awful. Had one mouthful and threw the rest out
