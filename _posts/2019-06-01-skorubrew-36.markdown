Making another smoked red ale set for the wedding.

Grain Bill
-----

* 900g maris otter
* 200g rice

Hop Schedule
-------------
* 2g Citra @ 30 minutes
* 2g Citra @ 20 minutes
* 2g Citra @ 10 minutes

Notes
------

* Ended up with a strange film on the top after cooking, tried to scoop off as much as I could
* Managed to keep most of the sediment out of the beer
* Original gravity came in a bit lower than expected, hoping it doesn't come out too weak
