While #1 is currently fermenting it's time for me to start thinking about #2. I don't yet know what #1 tastes like but I want to start work on a second to hedge my bets in case it turns out bad.

This one is going to be all from scratch, no kits, just all grain malt, hops and yeast. I want it to be pale in colour but with a moderate hop aroma and not too much bitterness.

--------

* Got my mash water to 70C and turned the stove top off but left it in place. After adding the malt the temp was still at 70C
* After 1 hour the mash temp was still at 68C which is nice
* Sparge water was at around 70C which was ok
* Boiling temp was at 98C with the lid covering. I tried to pour off the water on the lid a few times to get rid of DMS
* Original gravity came out at 1.040 which was slightly lower than expected but not too bad
* The whole thing smells like really strong hops but tastes more bitter than hoppy
* The colour as well is nice and light even though it's cloudy
* Seems like a big improvement over #1

Updates
-------

* 02-03-2016 08:00 Fermentation has started. Temp at 25C
