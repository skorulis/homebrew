While #1 is currently fermenting it's time for me to start thinking about #2. I don't yet know what #1 tastes like but I want to start work on a second to hedge my bets in case it turns out bad.

This one is going to be all from scratch, no kits, just all grain malt, hops and yeast. I want it to be pale in colour but with a moderate hop aroma and not too much bitterness.

Ingredients
-----

* Maris otter Malt 1kg
* Citra hops 2 x 5g
* Cascade hops 5g
* Safale american ale yeast (US-05)

Things I need to buy
-----

* bottling attachment
* BIAB Grain Bag
* Hydrometer
* Bottle brush
* Morgan's Lo Suds

* Beer supplies container?
* Funnel

Method
-------

* Heat water to 70 degrees
* Place malt in a bag and cover for 90 minutes
* Take out the malt bag and allow to drip
* Heat mash to 98 degrees and start timer
* After 10 minutes add mosaic hops
* After 50 minutes add 5g amarillo hops
* After 60 minutes remove from the heat and chill
* While chilling create a whirlpool to concentrate the particulate in the centre of the kettle
* After chilling transfer to the carboy
* Add yeast and the second 5g of amarillo
* Wait for fermentation
