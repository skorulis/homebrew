#4 is once again not going to be much of a change. The main difference from #3 is going to be the addition of chocolate malt to make it more of a stout than a pale ale. Though since the rest of the beer is the same I'm not sure how much difference this will make

Ingredients
-----

* Maris otter Malt 1kg
* Quick oats 100g
* Chocolate malt 100g
* Citra hops 7g @ flameout
* Citra hops 5g dry hop
* Cascade hops 5g dry hop
* Cascade hops 5g @ 50 minutes
* Safale american ale yeast (US-05)

Method
-------

* Prepare 6.5L of campden tablet treated water
* Heat 4L of water to 70 degrees
* Cook oats separately in the microwave so they don't clump when added to the mash
* Place malt and oats in a bag and cover for 60 minutes
* Take out the malt bag and allow to drip
* Pour the remaining 2L @75C of water over the closed bag
* Heat mash to 100 degrees and start timer
* Sanitise fermenter
* After 10 minutes add 5g cascade hops
* After 60 minutes remove from the heat and chill
* At flameout add 7g citra hops
* After chilling transfer to the carboy
* Wait for fermentation
* Leave in the fermenter for 4 weeks
* Once fermentation has settled down add 5g of citra and 5g cascade to dry hop

--------

* Even before I added the oats the grain was clumping but not as bad as last time, the temperature started at 71 and only dropped to 69C so I didn't need to worry about reheating and I kind of want this beer to be a bit dryer anyway
* Original gravity came in at 1.058 (14 brix). I thought it would be a little higher due to the extra 100g of grain but that's still an ok result
* My crappy stick on thermometer is making it really hard to see the temperature. I think the yeast went in at 16C but it could be as high as 26C.
* This time I only used half a packet of yeast. I hope this will make it smell less yeasty at the end and also make my yeast go further
