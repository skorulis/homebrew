Changing up my brewing procedure to see how the beer comes out. Trying a lower mash temperature and a quicker chill. Keeping the beer simple to better notice these changes.

Grain Bill
-----

* 1.1 Kg Maris otter


Hop Schedule
-------------

* 1g Amarillo @ 30 minutes
* 2g Amarillo @ 20 minutes
* 2g Amarillo @ 10 minutes
* 3g Amarillo @ Flameout
* 5g Amarillo Dryhop for 3 days



Method
-------

* Batch sparge with water 70C
* Bring to boil and leave for 1 hour
* Chill in ice bath straight after boil


Updates
-------

* The ice bath got the beer under 30C in about 15 minutes. Much quicker than what I normally do. I left it for a bit longer in the ice bath before pitching
