Grain Bill
-----

* 1KG pilsner
* 300g carared

Hop Schedule
-------------

* 3g Galaxy at 30 minutes
* 3g Galaxy at 20 minutes
* 3g Galaxy at 10 minutes
* 10g Galaxy dry hop


Notes
------

* Had to add some more heat during the mash because the water temp dropped too much from the grain
* Used a heat pad during the mash but temperature dropped to mid 60s by the end
* Quite a lot of boil off so topped up with some chilled water to help cool the wort and then some more from the tap to get to 4.5L
