Tasting {{ page.rating }} /10
--------

On my first tasting this was really bad. 2 months later it’s improved significantly. The head dies off immediately, and it’s got too much coffee flavour but as a slow drink it’s ok. I’m not left wanting another one. Perhaps it will improve more after another 2 months

* Updates
-----

* 26-11-2016 - Reading of 12.5 brix, 6.5% ABV. Smells a bit wrong, like the hops aren't a good fit with the malt.
* 01-12-2016 - Added roasted coconut and willamette as dry hops
* 12-12-2016 - Seems a bit all over the place at bottling. Too much bitterness overriding the other flavours
