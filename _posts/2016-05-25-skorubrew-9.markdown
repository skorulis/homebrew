A very similar beer to #3 with the addition of a little lactose and flour. Flour because I wanted to experiment with it and lactose because I need to find some use for it outside of stouts.

-----

* Maris otter Malt 1kg
* Quick oats 150g
* 50g lactose
* 50g flour
* Half packet of US-05 Yeast
* Citra hops 10g
* Cascade hops 10g

Method
-------

* Mash at 70C for 1 hour
* Batch sparge with water 70-75C

Hop Schedule
-------------

* Citra hops 5g @ flameout
* Citra hops 5g dry hop
* Cascade hops 5g dry hop
* Cascade hops 5g @ 50 minutes

----------

* Mixed the flour in with the oats before giving it a quick microwave. Seemed to cause the oats to clump a little bit when added to the mash
* Tried a new method of squeezing the bag by putting it in a colander and pushing down with a bowl. Much less messy but not sure if it gets the same efficiency as using my hands.
* Put the lactose in with about 20 minutes left on the boil
* Gravity came in at lower than 3 despite the addition of more ingredients
